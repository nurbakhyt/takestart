# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

All five labels exist in the tracker (`gh label list`). They are **states of the triage pipeline**, and they sit alongside GitHub's default labels (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, …), which describe **what kind of thing** the issue is. An issue can carry both: `enhancement` + `needs-triage` while it waits, `enhancement` + `ready-for-agent` once it is specified. A role label moves forward (`needs-triage` → `needs-info` / `ready-for-agent` / `ready-for-human` / `wontfix`); a default label stays.

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label string from this table.
